# Web Development Project

Musa Barber Shop is a full-stack web application developed as a group project during the Web Development Project course at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. The application is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The backend is implemented with Node.js and Express.js, while the frontend is developed using React.js.

## Technologies Used:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing user data, appointments, and other relevant information.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js used to build the backend API.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for developing the frontend of the application.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment used for executing server-side code.
